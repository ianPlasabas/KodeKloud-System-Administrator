TASK:
The Nautilus production support team was trying to fix issues with their storage server. 
The storage server has a shared directory /opt, which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server 
under /opt can be shared among all app servers. Somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.

Identify the root cause of the issue and fix it to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.

ssh natasha@ststor01
