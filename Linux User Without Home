The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, 
as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. 
They are finished with all apps except for App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

Create a user named john in App Server 2 without a home directory

COMMANDS:
ssh steve@stapp02
sudo su -
id john
useradd --help
useradd -M john
