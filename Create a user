TASK:
For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user.
This will be theApache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory.

Create the user as per requirements given below:
a. Create a user named yousuf on the App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Set UID to 1128 and its home directory to /var/www/yousuf.

COMMANDS:
ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su -
useradd -u 1128 yousuf
id yousuf
usermod --help
usermod -d /var/www/yousuf -m yousuf
