TASK:
The Nautilus system admins team recently deployed a web UI application for their backup utility running on the Nautilus backup server in Stratos Datacenter. 
The application is running on port 6200. They have firewalld installed on that server. The requirements that have come up include the following:

Open all incoming connection on 8089/tcp port. Zone should be home Firewall on  Backup Server

COMMANDS:
ssh clint@stbkp01
sudo su -
firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone=home --add-port=8089/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl restart firewalld
firewall-cmd --zone=home --list-all
