TASK:
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . 
App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

COMMANDS:
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf
sudo vi !$ 
  (Change nameserver 127.0.0.11 -> 8.8.8.8)
